# face-detection-greeting-system
#This project focuses on developing a robust face recognition and greeting model
using computer vision tools like OpenCV, DeepFace,and TensorFlow, integrated
with hardware components such as Raspberry Pi. The primary objective is to
accurately identify individuals from a database and greet them by name in real-
time. This system holds significant potential for deployment in various
environments including offices, hospitals, and other public spaces for purposes
ranging from enhanced personalized interactions to security and attendance
monitoring.
